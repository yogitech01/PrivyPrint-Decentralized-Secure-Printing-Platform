# PrivyPrint-Decentralized-Secure-Printing-Platform
PrivyPrint is a Web3-based secure printing platform that enables encrypted document sharing without exposing phone numbers or storing files on centralized servers. Using MetaMask, IPFS, AES-256 encryption, and smart contracts, it provides time-bound, revocable, and privacy-preserving access for secure document printing.
# 🔐 PrivyPrint – Decentralized Secure Printing Platform

## Overview

PrivyPrint is a Web3-powered secure document printing platform designed to eliminate privacy risks in traditional print-shop workflows. Instead of sharing documents through messaging apps or email, users securely upload encrypted files that are stored on IPFS and controlled through blockchain-based access permissions.

The platform ensures that only the designated print shop can decrypt and print a document within a predefined time window, while preserving user privacy and preventing unauthorized file retention.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional printing workflows require users to share documents via WhatsApp, email, or USB drives, exposing:

* Personal phone numbers
* Sensitive document contents
* Permanent file retention on print-shop systems
* Unauthorized copying and misuse

PrivyPrint addresses these concerns using encryption, decentralized storage, and blockchain-based access control.
